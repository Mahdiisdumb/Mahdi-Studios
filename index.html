                <h1>Mahdi Studios - Where 12-13-Year-Old Stubbornness Turns Ideas into Spaghetti. See Project SDSG for Proof.</h1>
                <p>
                    At Mahdi Studios we believe: if there's a will, there is most definitely a way.  
                    Is it the right way? Absolutely not. If Mahdi has an idea, it doesn't rhyme with "grug" sadly,  
                    and somehow we still turn it into code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are a vitamin-D-powered group of 12-13-year-olds, fueled by bad ideas, stubbornness, and pure chaos.
                    We also mod stuff - hence Deltatraveler decomp - but instead of hacking it, we probably just turn it into spaghetti.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything here is open source because Mahdi is a dumbass who uses ChatGPT (yes, this AI)  
                    and thinks he's legally obligated to make it open source since the AI did all the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our determination is not determination. It is stubbornness.  
                    If something works, it was an accident, and if it breaks, that's normal.

            Stuff we've made, broken, or accidentally shipped. Live data pulled from Mahdiisdumb GitHub.  
            No marketing fluff. No screenshots. No promises anything works.  
            Sometimes code is spaghetti. Sometimes it's slightly less spaghetti.  
            Everything is open source because Mahdi is a dumbass and AI made him do it.

        <h2>About Mahdi Studios (Lower Your Expectations)</h2>
        <p>
            Mahdi Studios is run by Mahdi and three equally confused 12-13-year-olds.  
            None of us know what we're doing. That is not a joke. That is the business model.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Mahdi has an idea, it doesn't rhyme with "grug" sadly.  
            Mahdi once got a <strong>2.35%</strong> on a test in the third grade.  
            That's the level of excellence we operate at.
        </p>
        <p>
            We code, break, laugh, mod, decompile, and somehow ship spaghetti that we call software.  
            Bugs are features. Glitches are art. Stubbornness is our determination.  
            Everything is open source because Mahdi is a dumbass and AI did everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            In short: dumb ideas + let's fuck around and see what happens + middle schoolers + stubbornness = Mahdi Studios.
